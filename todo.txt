- Find stylised facts that we want to match:
Look some paper that does this, maybe Ivan or Elisa?

-- Information diffuse slowly
-- Misinformation has an effect but a lower one
-- We match kurtosis and skewness
-- Inequality, pareto? 80% are gaining and 20% are losing?

- Simulated method of moments instead of Black Box?

sigma_gamma -> sigma_nu
sigma_theta -> sigma_eta

De groot derivation is incorrect

-check citep, parentheses

-do de groot in the limit for I that goes to infinity so variance goes to 0

- model with no learning
- de groot learning 
- our model
- impulse response --> save the weighting matrix object then upload it in different version
- motivate our model with adding positive feedback which is needed for skeweness and kurtosis
